## 👋 About Me

I'm someone who finds clarity in complexity. I’m drawn to patterns, systems, and the invisible links that hold everything together. Whether I’m writing code or sketching ideas, I enjoy building things that are both functional and thoughtful.

I believe good work comes from quiet curiosity and continuous refinement—not rushing to the finish line. I like to keep things simple on the outside, and meaningful underneath.
