## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **software engineer** with a systems mindset and a creative heart.  
My journey started with **C#** and has grown into full-stack engineering, with a deep focus on **backend architecture** and **clean, purposeful system design**.

**Current fascinations:**
- Architecting scalable **web applications**
- Building commercial systems with **ASP.NET Core** and **Web APIs**
- Exploring patterns like **DDD** (Domain-Driven Design) and modern architectural styles
- Designing thoughtful UIs with minimal, human-centered UX
- Learning modern frontend frameworks (currently exploring **React**)
- Experimenting with **AI + IoT** to create smart, connected tools
