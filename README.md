## 👋 About Me

I'm someone who finds clarity in complexity. I’m drawn to patterns, systems, and the invisible links that hold everything together. Whether I’m writing code or sketching ideas, I enjoy building things that are both functional and thoughtful.

I enjoy wearing multiple hats—developer, thinker, and system designer. I've worked across both front-end and back-end, and I love diving deep into software architecture, experimenting with approaches like DDD, EDD, and beyond.

I'm also the kind of person who gets excited by raw ideas—I've explored multiple startup concepts, and I’m constantly shaping new ones. Curiosity drives me, whether I'm exploring microcontrollers for an IoT project or merging AI into something tangible.
